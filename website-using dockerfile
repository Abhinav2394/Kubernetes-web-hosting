6. Login to docker hub using “docker login” command and give username and password
7. Run command “ docker image push username/image-name“
8. Come to the master node of Kubernetes and make directory where you can make definition file for the Deployment and Service
9. Make Deployment-defnition file with .yml extension and make entry
     
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
      name: dep-1
spec:
      replicas: 23
      selector:
              matchLabels:
                      app: abhinav
      template:

                             image: abhi3136/new_kube

10. Run deployment-definition file with command “ kubectl create -f file-name.yml “
11. Make NodePort Service definition file with .yml extension and make entry

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
     name: node-port-project-1
spec:
     selector:
         app: abhinav
     type: NodePort
     ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30009

12. Run the Service Definition file with command “kubectl create -f file-name.yml” 

Here website is running on 30009 port number
